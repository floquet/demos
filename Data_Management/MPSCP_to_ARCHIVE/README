Description:
The mpscp utility can generate multiple scp threads to transfer files.
This directory has simple scripts which you can edit to move files to and from
archive storage and topaz.

You must copy and edit these scripts for your use.  In their present form,
you are the user, and the file archive is on the archive host,
gold.erdc.hpc.mil.  The file archive is NOT mounted on topaz. 

In TAR_then_SAVE, the target directory there is Archive_Example/.

Since mpscp uses scp, a valid Kerberos ticket is required.  Therefore, mpscp
is not recommended for use in batch jobs.  Instead, you should use the
"archive" utility in batch jobs.

Please read the file mpscp.info for additional information.
