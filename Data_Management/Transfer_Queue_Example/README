This sample is named "Transfer_Queue_Example".

Overview:
This sample has two basic PBS scripts for use in the transfer queue.

They should be edited to place your project account number in the appropriate
position in the script preambles.  The location of the tar command should be
edited to be the parent directory of the data you need to archive or to be
placed, and the tar command should be edited appropriately to retrieve or
place your data.

Usage:
Submit the transfer_get and/or transfer_put queue jobs at the same time as
the primary processing job and use dependencies to control the execution order.
