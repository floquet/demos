This sample is named "Postprocess_Example".

The sample is the PBS script post-process.pbs that runs the picalc.topaz MPI
binary and then submits another script that performs post-processing work on
the resulting data.  It demonstrates use of the transfer queue, archive
command, and 'here' script to post-process data.  Note also use of a job
dependency to inform PBS when to execute the post-processing job.

The script itself is a bash script.  A modest change can be made to convert
it to a csh/tcsh script. Just insert a single "set" command.

To run it:

Copy the example to any directory you own:

    cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Data_Management/Postprocess_Example $WORKDIR

Enter the directory and compile picalc.topaz:

    cd $WORKDIR/Postprocess_Example ; make

Edit post-process.pbs to place your project id string in the two locations
"project_id".

The post-process.pbs script is set for the default SGI MPT.  If you used
Intel's MPI when linking, you will also need to swap to the same intelmpi
module at any point in the script before mpirun is called.

Submit the job:

   qsub post-process.pbs

Review the output of the job and the PBS job scripts when it has completed.
Note that the job submitted from within post-process.pbs is set to place its
job output in your $HOME directory.
