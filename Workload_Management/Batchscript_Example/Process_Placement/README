Process Placement on Topaz
---------------------------

The PBS option

#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36

reserves 1 node of 36 cores.  If the cores of the nodes are not to be
fully utilized, then the value of <num_cpus> = <num_nodes>*<36 cores/node>
needs to be larger than the value of <procs>.  For example,

#PBS -l select=4:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=32
aprun -n 128  ./a.out

will place 128 MPI processes on 4 nodes with 32 processes per node.

The processes will be placed in order that they appear in $PBS_NODEFILE for
the job.  So the first 32 processes will be placed on the first node, the
second 32 on the second node, and so on.

It is possible to change the way MPI processes are placed on the nodes.

To do this, the order in which the node names appear in $PBS_NODEFILE must
be changed.  Review the PBS script to get an idea of how this may be done.
