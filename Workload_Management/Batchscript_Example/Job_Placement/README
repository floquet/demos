Process Placement on Topaz
---------------------------

The placement of processes belonging to PBS job can be localized by using
additional specifiers in the "#PBS select" statement.

The format of the modified "select" statement is

  #PBS place=scatter:excl:group=<specifier>

where <specifier> is one of switch, iru, iru2, rack, rack2, rack4, rack8,
or rack16.  Choice of the group is indicated by the following counts of nodes
in which to place your job:
 
  nodes <= 18     switch
  nodes <= 36     iru
  nodes <= 72     iru2
  nodes <= 144    rack
  nodes <= 288    rack2
  nodes <= 576    rack4
  nodes <= 1152   rack8
  nodes <= 2304   rack16

Use of a group specifier does not guarantee exclusive use of all nodes in
that group; generally, the PBS job will share the group with other jobs, but
the job will have exclusive use of the nodes that are assigned to it.  Note
that use of a group may delay placement of the job, but in turn may allow
better communication performance as a consequence of more locally placed
processes.

This directory contains a small program called show_placement.c that
shows the placement of processes on the nodes assigned to the job.
The user should copy the contents of this directory into a subdirectory
in the user's $WORKDIR or $HOME.

The program can be compiled by entering "make" at the command line prompt.
The default MPI C compiler is mpicc, which uses Gnu C to compile, and it links
SGI MPT.  To use Intel's IMPI, swap modules to one of the Intel MPI modules,
say mpi/intelmpi, and uncomment the line setting MPICC to mpiicc
in the Makefile.

The program can be run using the batch script place.bat by entering

  qsub place.bat

at the prompt.  The account information in place.bat will need to be changed
to match your project allocation(s).  Be certain to use the mpirun command
appropriate for the MPI used in the compilation.

Note that the PBS option

#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36

reserves 1 node of 36 cores.  If the cores of the nodes are not to be
fully utilized, then the value of <num_cpus> = <num_nodes>*<36 cores/node>
needs to be larger than the value of <procs>.  For example,

#PBS -l select=4:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=9
mpiexec_mpt -n 36 ./a.out

will place 9 MPI processes on each of the 4 nodes for a total of 36 processes.
