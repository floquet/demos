How to set up a job dependency:

This example demonstrates use of the PBS flag -W to set up a job dependency.
A job dependency informs PBS about conditions under which to execute a job
that depends on how other job(s) finish or sets up something that subsequent
job(s) depend upon to start.

To set up a job dependency, use "#PBS -W depend=<dependency-string>:<jobid(s)>
where <dependency-string> is any one of
  after
  afterok
  afternotok
  afterany
  before
  beforeok
  beforenotok
  beforeany
  on
and <jobid(s)> is the job id number of a currently executing job.  <jobid(s)>
may be a colon-separated list of jobs that are on Topaz at the time of 
submission.  Read the "qsub" man page for more information about how to use
the dependency strings above.

Copy this example to a directory you own, such as $WORKDIR:
  cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Workload_Management/Job_Dependency_Example $WORKDIR

Enter it and edit the two files Submit_first.pbs and Job_Depends.pbs to place
the correct string for your project charge code after  "#PBS -A".

Assemble the example binaries using the Makfile:
  make

Run the example by executing the script "run_example".  The script submits
the first job using Submit_first.pbs, then captures the job id of that job
and places it in the #PBS -W preamble statement of a new PBS script it writes
named "Submit_second.pbs".  It submits that script and captures the job id
of the new job and places it in the same position as before in a new script
named "Submit_third.pbs".  It then submits Submit_third.pbs.

Output showing the dependencies is saved in the ascii file "queued_record".
