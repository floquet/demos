How to run a mix of serial and parallel tasks simultaneously on 3 compute nodes:

PBS uses the compute nodes to run jobs on Topaz, not batch or mom nodes as on
  Garnet.  For this reason, it is possible to run numerically intensive
  serial tasks in PBS jobs without crashing the batch nodes and bringing down
  the entire system.  However, to run them on other nodes assigned to the job,
  mpirun must be used.  However, not all mpirun commands available on Topaz
  execute serial binaries.  The mpiexec_mpt command is this way, but the mpirun
  command available in the SGI MPT modules will, but not without issuing an
  erroneous error message.  The mpirun command in the Intel MPI modules can
  be used, however.

In this example, the script "serial_jobs.sh" will be sent to one compute node,
  using a subset of its cores to run 8 serial processes.  The mpirun command
  in the Intel MPI modules is used for this.  Note use of the -hosts flag to
  place the serial tasks on one of the nodes assigned to the job.

A simple MPI code will be sent to the remaining 2 nodes, running on all 72
  cores.

Topaz nodes have 36 cores per node, so you could run 36 serial jobs at the 
  same time on one node.

Note that on Topaz, the syntax of having a hostname or hostlist following
  "mpirun" in the submit script is understood by SGI's mpirun only.  Intel's
  mpirun requires the -hosts and -np flags along with their respective
  arguments.

In serial_jobs.sh, note the syntax of using ksh and ( )& to put each serial
  task into the background.  You are not limited to what you put between
  the parentheses.

For example, just one serial task could have been:

( cd /some/where/else
  mkdir some_new_dir
  cd some_new_dir
  cp /from/another/place/your/executable .
  cp /from/another/place/your/inputfile .
  ./executable  < inputfile  > my_best_stuff
  cp my_best_stuff $WORKDIR
  rm *
) &


Copy this sample to your workspace:

    cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Workload_Management/Mix_Serial_with_Parallel $WORKDIR

Enter that directory, compile the binaries using make, and then edit the PBS
  script "submit.pbs" to place your project ID string after #PBS -A.

    cd $WORKDIR/Mix_Serial_with_Parallel ; make ; vi submit.pbs

Submit the job to Topaz' debug queue

    qsub submit.pbs

Review the results, the script "serial_jobs.sh", and the PBS script
  "submit.pbs" after the job completes.
