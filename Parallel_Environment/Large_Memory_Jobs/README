Instructions on Execution of jobs Requiring Big-Memory Nodes on Topaz:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A sample PBS job script is provided for you to copy for use to execute
large memory jobs, those requiring significantly more than about 3 GB memory
per node.

There are 4 large memory nodes, each having 32 cores per node.  The nodes
have Intel Xeon E5-4620 v2 Ivy Bridge processors operating at 2.6 GHz base
speed.  Turbo-boost and hyperthreading are enabled.

Importantly, the large memory nodes do not support all of the instruction sets
that the standard compute and GPU nodes support.  Therefore, it may be wise,
if compiling a highly optimized code, to add the flags "-xAVX" for code
intended for the large memory nodes, but "-xCORE-AVX2" for code to run on the
standard compute and GPU nodes.  Use of the flag "-xHOST", if used on the
login nodes, which are Haswell nodes, could generate code using instructions
sets that will not execute on the large memory nodes.  Such codes would
generate errors from attempted use of illegal instructions.

To specify the big memory nodes, the 'select' statement in the preamble
has the following form:

  #PBS -l select=<1-4>:ncpus=32:mpiprocs=<1-64>:bigmem=1

Attempts to submit jobs to the big memory nodes that do not follow this
specification, and that do not satisfy the specifications for standard compute
nodes or GPGPU nodes, will result in an error message being issued that may
include information detailing the correct format of the 'select' statement.

This script is provided for you to adapt as you require.  Although job
submission may be in any directory owned by the user, execution is to
be in either $WORKDIR or $WORKDIR2, NOT $HOME.  Once you have a working
revision of "large_memory.pbs", a copy can be placed in $HOME as a backup
to guard against inadvertent deletion.
