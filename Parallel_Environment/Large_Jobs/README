Instructions on execution of jobs requiring more than 11k cores on topaz:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sample PBS job script is provided for you to copy for use to execute
large jobs, those requiring more than 11,000 cores or 305 nodes, on topaz.

1. SGI MPT 2.12 or later must be used.  To swap from an earlier version, do

     module swap mpi/sgimpt/<earlier version> mpi/sgimpt

   before you issue the mpiexec_mpt command.

   For reference, SGI MPT 2.13 beta had been available for use with large jobs,
   and the user was responsible to set the following variables:
     export MPI_CONNECTIONS_THRESHOLD=8192
     export MPI_BUFS_PER_PROC=2048
     export MPI_IB_RECV_MSGS=16384
     export MPI_IB_TIMEOUT=22
     export MPI_IB_FAILOVER=127
     export MPI_IB_ACCELERATE_AHS=true
     export MPI_IB_MAX_RDMAS=1
     export MPI_IB_PAYLOAD=128
     export MPI_MSG_RETRIES=20000000
     export MPI_IB_RNR_TIMER=26
     export MPI_VERBOSE=1
     export MPI_DISPLAY_SETTINGS=1

   Recommendation was also made to use "mpiexec_mpt -v".

2. "Export"/"setenv" one environment variable, MPI_IB_CONGESTED=1, to inform
   Topaz that you intend to run a large job.

The script is provided for you to adapt as you require.  Submission is to
be in either $WORKDIR or $WORKDIR2, NOT $HOME.  Once you have a working
revision, a copy can be placed in $HOME as a backup to guard against
inadvertent deletion.
