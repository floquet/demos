Simple MPI example.
-------------------

This document is for the Gnu compiler suite.
The document README is for MPI using the Intel compiler.

Copy these files to a subdirectory of your $WORKDIR.

The C language program hello.c lists the node name for each MPI process.

The utilization of two different MPI environments are shown,
MPT (SGI MPI) and IMPI (Intel MPI).

The default MPI of topaz is MPT.  The "module list" command should
show some version of sgimpt, for example

> module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) mpi/sgimpt/2.12-11218

To use Intel MPI the module swap command would be

module swap mpi/sgimpt mpi/intelmpi

or choose a specific version of Intel MPI, for example,

module swap mpi/sgimpt mpi/intelmpi/15.0.3

In addition, the default compiler is Intel.
The command

> module avail compiler

will show the available compilers.

The Gnu compiler that are available are
compiler/gcc/4.8.5 and compiler/gcc/4.9.3

For these examples, swap the compiler, for example,

module swap compiler/intel compiler/gcc/4.9.3

You can check that the compiler wrappers are using the Gnu compiler suite
by using the commands
mpicc --version
mpicxx --version
mpif90 --version

These commands can be used for either MPI implementation,
SGI MPT or Intel MPI.  The wrappers are actually found
in different directoriers, depending on the MPI implementation
being used.

Before submitting a job, the user needs to compile and link
the program.  Just to keep the executable names separate,
the following compile-and-link commands are suggested.

mpicc -O3 -o mpt_gcc_hello.exe hello.c -lmpi  # SGI MPT

or

mpicc -O3 -o impi_gcc_hello.exe hello.c   # Intel MPI

For SGI MPT, the commands mpicc, mpicxx and mpif90 will use the compiler
specified by MPICC_CC, MPICXX_CXX and MPIF90_F90.
For Intel MPI, the commands mpicc, mpicxx and mpif90 will use the
compiler specified by I_MPI_CXX, I_MPI_CC, I_MPI_FC, I_MPI_F90 and
I_MPI_F77.  These values are set when a compiler module is loaded,
e.g. compiler/intel/15.0.3 or compiler/gcc/4.9.3.

An executable compiled for SGI MPT can be submitted with the script
mpt_gcc_hello.pbs.  Notice that the executable is launched with
mpiexec_mpt.  For SGI MPT, do not use mpirun to launch the job.

An executable compiled for Intel MPI can be submitted with the script
impi_gcc_hello.pbs.  Notice that the executable is launched with mpirun.

In the batch script, change the account number to the value assigned to
your project.

One point to be made to avoid confusion.  The Intel MPI implementation
is in a subdirectory of the Intel compiler.  Nonetheless, the Gnu
compiler suite can be used with the Intel MPI implementation.
In other words, the choice of mpi/intelmpi/15.0.3 does not mean
that you are choosing the Intel compiler.
