In order to make the most efficient use of DoD funding, the HPCMP is trying to 
better understand actual software utilization on its HPC platforms. As a part 
of this effort, a character string resource called “application” has been 
introduced. Users are encouraged to add a line to their batch script of 
the form:

    #PBS -l application=name

For example:

    #PBS -l application=Abaqus
or
    #PBS -l application=LS-Dyna

For the purposes of characterizing actual resource utilization on DoD HPCMP 
resources, the resource “application” is set to the name of the application 
used within the batch script. A list of recognized application names is
provided in the file called application_names. A value of "Other" is acceptable
for applications not in the list.
   
Capitalization is not important, for example, Abaqus, ABAQUS, and abaqus are 
all equally acceptable. What is most important is that the application name be 
one from the list of possible choices found in the application_names file. 

Users are encouraged to add this new line to ALL their PBS scripts.
