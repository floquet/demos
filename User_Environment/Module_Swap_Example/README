How to swap one module for another in a PBS job:
------------------------------------------------

Copy the entire example over to any directory you own, eg., your workspace:

  cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/User_Environment/Module_Use_Example $WORKDIR

Enter that directory and review the README:

  cd $WORKDIR/User_Environment/Module_Use_Example
  view README

Edit the sample PBS job execution file and submit it to topaz:

  qsub swap_mods.pbs

Initialization of module commands in the PBS script prior to issuing the first
is accomplished most easily by using $MODULESHOME.  Example of how to perform
this action, and then use module commands to view and exchange user modules
are provided in swap_mods.pbs.
