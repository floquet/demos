Common Environment Variables:
============================

The Baseline Configuration Team has established common variables to enhance
portability of software and projects administered by the HPCMP.  These
variables are intended to reduce the overhead to maintain operable scripts
and software, and to ease migration of software and supporting scripts onto
new systems and between systems as allocations change.  The definitions of
these variables are common to every allocated system administered by the HPCMP,
but the specific values differ from system to system.

The variables are the following:

$ARCHIVE_HOME
 - user's directory on the archival file system that serves Topaz
   This directory is not mounted on Topaz, but data can be placed and retrieved
   using mpscp, archive commands (especially using the transfer queue), and ftp.

$ARCHIVE_HOST
 - The archive system, gold.

$BC_CORES_PER_NODE
 - The number of cores per node for the compute nodes to which a job has been
   submitted.

$BC_HOST
 - generic hostname of the system in lowercase letters, ie topaz.

$BC_MEM_PER_NODE
 - approximate maximum memory in integer MBytes available for processing

$BC_MPI_TASKS_ALLOC
 - number of MPI tasks allocated for a particular PBS job

$BC_NODE_ALLOC
 - numer of nodes allocated to a PBS job

$CC
 - default C compiler, ie icc.  Changes to the compiler module, eg. by
   "module swap compiler/intel compiler/gcc/4.9.3" will change the value to
   that environment, in this case, gcc.

$CENTER
 - path for your directory on the Center Wide File System (CWFS)

$COST_HOME
 - path to the base directory of the default installation of Common Open Source
   Tools (COST), ie /app/unsupported/COST on topaz.

$CSI_HOME
 - path to the base directory of the application codes installed on topaz under
   the Consolidated Software Initiative (CSI), ie /app on topaz

$CXX
 - default C++ compiler, ie icpc.  Changes to the compiler module, eg. by
   "module swap compiler/intel compiler/gcc/4.9.3" will change the value to
   that environment, in this case, g++.

$DAAC_HOME
 - path to the base directory for the Data Analysis and Assessment Center (DAAC)
   tools, ie /app/DAAC on topaz.  For more information, please refer to BC
   policy FY08-01 (DAAC Supported Visualization Tools) in the BCT policies
   webpage at the Centers website.

$F77
 - default Fortran 77 compiler, ie ifort.  Changes to the compiler module, eg. by
   "module swap compiler/intel compiler/gcc/4.9.3" will change the value to
   that environment, in this case, gfortran.

$F90
 - default Fortran 90 compiler, ie ifort.  Changes to the compiler module, eg. by
   "module swap compiler/intel compiler/gcc/4.9.3" will change the value to
   that environment, in this case, gfortran.

$JAVA_HOME
 - path to the base directory of the default installation of JAVA on topaz,
   ie /usr/lib64/jvm/jre

$KRB5_HOME
 - path to the installation directory of the Kerberos utilities,
   ie /usr/local/krb5

$PET_HOME
 - path to the system-wide directory containing tools installed and maintained
   by the PETTT staff, ie /app/unsupported/PETtools/CE.
 - The variable $PETTT_HOME has the same value.  
 - This variable has been deprecated and will be removed from the Baseline
   Configuration compliance monitoring in the future.  At that time, packages
   in $PET_HOME will be migrated to $COST_HOME as appropriate.

$PROJECTS_HOME
 - path to the base directory that contains subdirectories for each of the
   user-supported applications and codes under BC policy FY10-07 (Common
   Location to Maintain Codes) in the BCT policies webpage at the Centers
   website.

$SAMPLES_HOME
 - path to the base directory for example codes and scripts installed and
   maintained by ERDC DSRC staff under BC policy FY06-15 (Sample Code
   Repository) in the BCT policies webpage at the Centers website.

$WORKDIR
 - path to temporary local high-performance file system made available for use
   by executing programs to avoid slower file I/O across a network-mounted
   file system, such as the home and/or archival file systems.  Files in
   $WORKDIR are temporary and are not backed up nor exported to any other
   systems.  As such, files in $WORKDIR are your responsibility to retrieve
   for analysis or to archive in a timely manner.  On topaz, $WORKDIR is
   /p/work1/$USER
 - $WORKDIR2, with value /p/work2/$USER, is also available, with identical
   intent and usage regarding file preservation and lifetimes.
