Example of running namd in parallel.

Copy this directory to a subdirectory of your $WORKDIR.

Edit the file
namd-intel-sgimpt.pbs, namd-gcc49-sgimpt.pbs or namd-intel-intelmpi.pbs
for your project, and submit job "qsub namd-<version>.pbs"
where <version> is either intel-sgimpt, gcc49-sgimpt or intel-intelmpi.

Two gzip'ed tar files of input data are in this directory in case
the user wants to start clean after doing experiments, they are,
apoa1.tar.gz and f1atpase.tar.gz .

The input data files are
apoa1.namd  apoa1.psf  par_all22_prot_lipid.xplor
apoa1.pdb  par_all22_popc.xplor

Edit apoa1.namd , specifically, change the outputname.
The original text is
outputname           /usr/tmp/apoa1-out
If your $WORKDIR is /p/work2/research and you copied these
files to /p/work2/research/namd, for example,
then change the line to
outputname           /p/work2/research/namd/tmp/apoa1-out

Create the directory specified by outputname, for example,
mkdir $WORKDIR/namd/tmp

Three versions of namd have been built.
While all three versions ran well for the test cases,
the user can try different versions to see which runs best
for his or her particular dataset.
