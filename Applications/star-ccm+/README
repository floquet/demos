Description:
STAR-CCM+ is a multi-physics CFD (Computational Fuild Dynamics) code
from CD-adapco. 

This directory contains two test cases for STAR-CCM+. 

case 1:
- runs the default version of starccm+ (version 7.02) on 16 processes
- files: starccm.pbs, run.java, star.sim

case 2:
- discrete element modeling example
- runs version 8.04 of starccm+ on 96 processes using single stream mode
  and generates a set of images to visualize the solution
- files: star_dem.pbs, star_dem.java, star_dem.sim

Copy the appropriate set of files to your $WORKDIR, edit the *.pbs file to
specify your project number and the appropriate queue, and submit the job
using 
> qsub starccm.pbs
or 
> qsub star_dem.pbs

You can control the number of iterations taken by starccm+ by modifying the 
appropriate *.java file.
