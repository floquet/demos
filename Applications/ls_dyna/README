Description:
LS-Dyna is a multi-physics structure code. 

This directory contains a small test case for LS-Dyna. 

Copy this directory to your $WORKDIR, edit the file "lsdyna.pbs" for your
project, and submit job "qsub lsdyna.pbs".

You can use a version of "lsprepost...." in the directory
  "/app/ls-dyna/lsprepost" to view your output d3plot files.


LS-Dyna is a restricted access application.  Contact the ERDC DSRC for access.


LS-Dyna requires licenses to execute.  There are currently 500 license tokens
available for processing.  Of these, 200 are allowed for use with Advance
Reservation Service Jobs (ARS).  If you are having trouble finding a time
for your ARS reservations with LS-DYNA tokens, the following commands may
provide additional information:

SLB_disp_ARS_resv.pl
  This command shows all of the license reservations made by ARS.  LS-DYNA
  is listed near the bottom.

SLB_query_resv.pl -app lsdyna -nlic XX --st=MM/DD_HH:mm --dur YYY
  This command queries the reservation system to determine the next available
  time that an LS-DYNA job requiring XX tokens lasting YYY hours will be
  available at or after MM/DD_HH:mm, where
    MM is a two-digit entry for the month 
    DD is a two-digit entry for the day
    HH is the time in hours (0-23)
    mm is the time in minutes (0-59)
  The flag --help instructs SLB_query_resv.pl to provide information on usage,
  which includes default settings and values.

SLB_query_avail_t.pl --app lsdyna --tok=mppdyna -st=MM/DD_HH:mm
  This command computes the number of token available at time MM/DD_HH:mm.
  Meanings of MM, DD, HH, mm are as above.  Similarly to the above, --help
  instructs SLB_query_avail_t.pl to provide information on usage.
