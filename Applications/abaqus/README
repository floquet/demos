Description:
Basic batch script and input deck for an Abaqus job.

Change the account information in file abaqus.pbs
Run job using
qsub abaqus.pbs

The file abaqus_v6.env must be changed to reflect the version
you are using.  As of September 2014 the options are

/app/abaqus/6.12-1/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env
/app/abaqus/6.12-3/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env
/app/abaqus/6.13-1/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env
/app/abaqus/6.14-1/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env

If the batch script has the command
module load abaqus/6.12-3
then before running the script you need to copy the environment
file using

cp /app/abaqus/6.12-3/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env .

The above also applies to the current default since
module load abaqus
implies version 6.12-3

To explain further using a different example, if you have
in the batch script
module load abaqus/6.14-1

then before using qsub to start the job you need to do

cp /app/abaqus/6.14-1/SMA/site/abaqus_v6.env .

On the other hand, if there is no abaqus_v6.env file in your
$HOME directory and no abaqus_v6.env file in the work directory
from which you launch the job, then abaqus will find the
correct file based on which abaqus module version was loaded.

Moreover, if users have their own abaqus_v6.env file --
if, for example, they use a different license server --
then when changing the version of abaqus that they utilize,
some lines in their abaqus_v6.env file many need to
be changed.  The difference between two abaqus_v6.env files
from different versions may server as a guide for how a
user will need to change his/her file.

Notes:
 1. As of Dec 2015, csh is required for abaqus to execute
    correctly.
 2. The keyword 'interactive' is required at the end of the
    abaqus command for it to execute.
