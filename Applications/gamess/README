   The script for launching gamess, rungms, is a wrapper
that records the usage of the application.  The
actual script for setting-up environment variables
and starting gamess is rungms.orig.  The user may
need to copy and modify rungms.orig.  The file
"rungms.orig" is not the original rungms supplied by
the gamess developers, but rather, a version modified
for running on topaz.

Notice that, unlike some implementations of rungms,
the version of the executable is not a command
line option.  The version is always set to "00".
