Description:
Gaussian is used for calculating molecular electronic structure and properties. 
The package includes a wide range of ab initio and semi-empirical methods
for energy, gradient, frequency and property calculations.

This directory contains a small test case g09-parallel.pbs that you can
copy to your personal directory and submit as a batch job.  Be sure to
change the account (-A) option.

Gaussian is a restricted access application, contact the ERDC DSRC for access.

Notice that in order to use more than one node, the nodes listed in
$PBS_NODEFILE must be added as a line in your Gaussian command file.
The script g09-parallel.pbs shows how to do that.

Note that the example is taken from
 $g09root/g09/tests/com/test0397.com
and shows %mem=16MW
For actual calculations this value can be much higher.  It is the
amount of memory on one node, which is a maximum of %mem=118GB per
node (of memory available for user processes) on Topaz.

For test case test0397.com from the Gaussian source distribution,
the run times on topaz are the following.
