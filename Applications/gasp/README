3-D Rocket Problem
====================

The rocket problem is designed to be a GASP Version 4
tutorial for new users.  This tutorial and the Duct
should be the first tutorials that a user goes through. 
The rocket problem has been set up to run 1000 cycles on the
coarse grid, 2000 cycles on the medium grid, and 2000 cycles 
on the fine mesh.  In addition, the physical resources have 
been set up to run on a single processor for the coarse and 
medium sequences, and on 6 processors for the fine sequence. 
After the cycles have been completed, a PLOT3D grid and 
solution file will be automatically created containing the 
primitive variables.  If you desire to use more 
processors, you should perform domain decomposition using 
the GUI to meet target efficiencies. 

The remainder of this file gives an overview of the contents 
in this directory.


File                 Purpose
------------------------------------------------------
rocket.p3d           The rocket PLOT3D grid file.
rocket.pdf           The rocket tutorial in pdf format.
README               This text file.



Additional files for this tutorial can be downloaded from
the GASP Version 4 ftp site.  The additional files are not
necessary to perform the tutorial, but provides the user
with a ready to run version and a finished version of the
rocket problem.  These additional files appear as below.


Directory            Purpose
---------------------------------------------------------
ReadyToRun           The rocket problem has been set up and is
                     ready to run the coarse, medium and fine 
                     grids.  The fine grid is set to run
                     using 4 processors.  

Finished             The final solution to the rocket problem.
