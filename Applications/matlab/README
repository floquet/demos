Instructions for Interactive and Queued PBS processing with MATLAB
==================================================================

In order to run MATLAB, you must have permission to execute it.  This
is checked by listing your group permissions, viz groups userid, where userid
is your user id.  If you have permission to execute MATLAB, the group id
"matlab" will appear in  your group memberships.

Access to MATLAB is typically made by request to the HPC Help Desk.

Assuming you have access, MATLAB can be executed interactively or by
submission of a PBS job script.

You are requested to not run matlab on the login or PBS job (mom) nodes.
Doing so may place very large demands upon those nodes and inhibit other
users, in which case the system administrators will kill the MATLAB job.

You can avoid running on the login and mom nodes by running either an
interactive PBS job or a queued PBS job.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executing an interactive MATLAB job on the compute nodes:

If  you need to run an interactive job, say to use the GUI, then you
can submit an interactive job like this:

  qsub -A your-project-id -q standard -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=1:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36 -l matlab=1 -X -I

Note the request to use MATLAB licenses in -l matlab=x, where x is the number
of nodes in the job.  In the line above, 1 node is requested both in the
select= line and in the license request line matlab=1.

When the job begins, load the MATLAB module:

  module load matlab

Begin MATLAB processing:

  matlab

When finished, exit matlab and the cluster mode session, and exit the
interactive session.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitting a queued MATLAB job to run on the compute nodes:

If you do not need GUI or interactive access, you can submit a MATLAB job
and let it run whenever the cores and licenses are available.

So, create a MATLAB job script (.m script) and place it in the directory
from which you will submit the PBS job.  In that directory, edit a copy
of the PBS job script to copy the data files and script(s) to your work
directory ($WORKDIR), and then submit the job.

Be certain to retrieve your output data and results and archive it before it
is erased.  $WORKDIR is not intended for permanent storage.  Files placed
there are erased after 30 days.
