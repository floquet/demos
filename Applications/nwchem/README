ln -s /p/home/apps/unsupported/nwchem/6.5-gcc49/data/default.nwchemrc  $HOME/.nwchemrc

For 6.5-intel
ln -s /p/home/apps/unsupported/nwchem/6.5-intel/data/default.nwchemrc  $HOME/.nwchemrc

Copy this directory to your $WORKDIR, edit the nwchem.pbs file for your project,
 and submit job "qsub nwchem.pbs".
