The performance of MPI-IO was measured on topaz using the tool IOR.
The specific measurement was write bandwidth for collective parallel IO.

The IOR parameters were
 ./IOR -a MPIIO -w -c -H -C -g -s 3220 -b 100000 -t 10000 -i 2 -o myfile

POSIX runs were also done with IOR parameters
 ./IOR -a POSIX -w -C -e  -g -s 3220 -b 100000 -t 10000 -i 2 -o myfile

  144 processes were run using 36 MPI processses on each of 4 nodes.

Both file systems /p/home and /p/work2 were testing using both
SGI MPT and Intel MPI.

The tests for SGI MPT simply used the command line

mpiexec_mpt -n 144 ./IOR -a MPIIO \
 -w -c -H -C -g -s 3220 -b 100000 -t 10000 -i 2 -o myfile

The tests for Intel MPI needed to set environment variables
as shown below.

source $MODULESHOME/init/bash
module unload mpi
module load mpi/intelmpi/15.0.2

export I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM=on
export I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM_LIST=lustre

mpirun -n 144 ./IOR -a MPIIO \
 -w -c -H -C -g -s 3220 -b 100000 -t 10000 -i 2 -o myfile

If the I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM[_LIST] environment variables
are not set, then writing is slow.

Hints for opening files for MPI-IO can be set be defining a hint file
export ROMIO_HINTS=<filename>
For example, to change ind_wr_buffer_size
the hint file could have a line
ind_wr_buffer_size 1048576


The bandwidth measurements are the following.

On topaz, using SGI MPT on $HOME
MPI IO: Max Write: 90.20 MiB/sec (94.59 MB/sec)
MPI IO: Max Write: 90.94 MiB/sec (95.36 MB/sec)
POSIX:  Max Write: 30.96 MiB/sec (32.47 MB/sec)

On topaz, using Intel MPI on $HOME
MPI IO: Max Write: 88.09 MiB/sec (92.37 MB/sec)
MPI IO: Max Write: 90.69 MiB/sec (95.10 MB/sec)
( Without I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM=on , I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM_LIST=lustre
MPI IO: Max Write: 24.30 MiB/sec (25.48 MB/sec)
MPI IO: Max Write: 23.94 MiB/sec (25.10 MB/sec)
the bandwidth is much less. )
POSIX:  Max Write: 34.13 MiB/sec (35.79 MB/sec)

On topaz, using SGI MPT on $WORKDIR
MPI IO: Max Write: 185.74 MiB/sec (194.77 MB/sec)
MPI IO: Max Write: 192.49 MiB/sec (201.84 MB/sec)
POSIX:  Max Write: 33.21 MiB/sec (34.82 MB/sec)

On topaz, using Intel MPI on $WORKDIR
MPI IO: Max Write: 188.29 MiB/sec (197.44 MB/sec)
MPI IO: Max Write: 193.04 MiB/sec (202.42 MB/sec)
POSIX:  Max Write: 35.74 MiB/sec (37.48 MB/sec)

For comparison, on garnet, MPI-IO for collective IO calls
compared to POSIX I/O as measured by IOR on $WORKDIR
MPI IO: Max Write: 158.99 MiB/sec (166.71 MB/sec)
POSIX:  Max Write:  83.86 MiB/sec  (87.93 MB/sec)

The default hints were found to be (using IOR)

The hints for Intel MPI are when Lustre is specified using
export I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM=on
export I_MPI_EXTRA_FILESYSTEM_LIST=lustre

An example program is provided for showing the hints of a file
opened by MPI_File_open().  Copy the contents to your directory,
for example, a subdirectory of $WORKDIR .
Change the account information and "qsub test_hints.pbs" .
The PBS script will compile and link hints.c and
launch hints.exe .
