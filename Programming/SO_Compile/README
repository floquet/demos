Description:
Simple example of creating a SO (Shared Object) library, using
it to compile, and running against it on the compute nodes.

To use a home-grown SO library, you will need to compile using position-
independent-code flags, then link against it using -L, -l flags on the
link line.  To execute against it, you will need to extend the value of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path to the SO library at execution time.


To run this example:
  Copy the entire contents of this example to a directory you own, say $WORKDIR:
    > cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Programming/SO_Compile  $WORKDIR

  cd into the subdirectory $WORKDIR/SO_Compile/LIB_SRC/, and compile the
  example code there using the script "compile_so".

    > cd $WORKDIR/SO_Compile/LIB_SRC ; ./compile_so

  Modify the PBS script submit.pbs with your subproject id and submit.
  It should work as-is for SGI MPT.  Note that binaries compiled with Intel
  IMPI will require you to execute with the Intel IMPI module, in order to load
  all of the dynamic MPI libraries that Intel's mpirun will need.  PBS
  automatically loads the SGI MPT modules into your environment at job
  execution, so you may need to load the correct MPI module in the
  script to ensure correct execution at run time.  Uncomment the module
  swap commands and the mpirun command, and comment out the mpiexec_mpt
  command, to execute in the Intel IMPI environment.
