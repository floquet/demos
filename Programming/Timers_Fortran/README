Example: Demonstrate five different Fortran Timers.
         Four are intrinsic timers, great for sequential codes.  The other
         is MPI_WTIME(), recommended for MPI codes, but it can be used for
         sequential codes as well.  It requires the MPI header file mpif.h
         and calls to MPI_INIT and MPI_FINALIZE for proper initialization and
         error/warning-free (clean) exit.

                        Timer Intrinsic
                        ===============
!  F77 intrinsic          SECNDS

!  F90/95 intrinsic       SYSTEM_CLOCK

!  F90/95 intrinsic       CPU_TIME

!  F95/2000+ intrinsic    DATE_AND_TIME

   Notes: The accuracy of CPU_TIME is reported to be questionable.
          For MPI codes, MPI_Wtime is recommended.  It requires the "mpif.h"
          include file.

Instructions:
Copy the directory and its contents to your work directory:

  cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Programming/Timers_Fortran $WORKDIR

Enter that directory and compile the code:

  cd $WORKDIR/Timers_Fortran ; ./compile

After topaz enters production, you will need to edit submit.pbs to place
the allocation charge code for your PBS job after #PBS -A.  Prior to,
skip this edit.

Submit the job:

  qsub submit.pbs

Review the output and the Fortran timers calls when the job is done.
