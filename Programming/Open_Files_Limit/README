Maximum Number of Concurrently Open Files:
=========================================

   The number of open files for one process is limited to 16384 by default.
   This is the number reported by the bash shell "ulimit" command, and it
   is both the hard limit and the soft limit, ie, the values returned by
   "ulimit -S -a" and "ulimit -H -a".  It includes files descriptors used
   for Unix pipes, as well as normal files.  However, for a user program
   the default limit is around 16380.

   The number of open files can be changed by using the command
   "ulimit -n <new max>" in a bash PBS batch script or in an interactive
   PBS session, before calling mpiexec_mpt, or mpirun if using Intel MPI.
   After the limit is changed, it can only be lowered in the same job.

   For csh or tcsh shell, the command is

     limit descriptiors <new max>

   The number of open files should be as few as possible because of the
   load on the Lustre filesystem metadata server.  Use of thousands of
   open files, as shown in this example, is NOT recommended.
