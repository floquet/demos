Example of compiling a BLACS example code using Intel's MKL
-----------------------------------------------------------

Intel's BLACS are included in their Math Kernel Library (MKL).

N.B. The BLACS set up a process grid.  In blacs_example.f, it is as close to
     square as possible.  Since 36 cores are available on one node, all 36 will
     participate in the process grid to solve the numerical problem, 36 being a
     perfect square.


Instructions:
Copy the directory and its contents to your work directory:

  cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Programming/MKL_BLACS_Example $WORKDIR

Enter that directory and compile the code:

  cd $WORKDIR/MKL_BLACS_Example ; ./compile

It assumes the default environment: SGI MPT and Intel compilers.

After Topaz enters production, edit submit.pbs to place the allocation charge
code for your PBS job after #PBS -A.

Submit the job:

  qsub submit.pbs

Review the output when the job is done.
