To compile MPI codes:

There are two compilers, Intel and Gnu, and two flavors
of MPI - SGI's MPT and Intel's IMPI.

Read MPI_Compilers.txt to find which MPI compiler scripts to use.

If no specific version number is stated, then the default is assumed,
although you may use any available version.

To see what module compiler/intel/15.0.3 is, for example, enter
"module show compiler/intel/15.0.3".
