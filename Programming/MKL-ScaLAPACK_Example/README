Compiling and executing code using ScaLAPACK and BLACS routines in Intel's MKL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intel has tuned BLACS and ScaLAPACK routines in their Math Kernel Library.
As such, MKL is probably the best choice for heavy numerical computations
using parallelized array and vector operations.

Using Intel's compiler, SGI's MPI library (MPT), and Intel's Math Kernel
  Library (MKL).

Compile.sh will use the MKL library to compile the example code with SGI's
  MPT. 

Instructions:
Copy the directory and its contents to your work directory:

  cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Programming/MKL-ScaLAPACK_Example $WORKDIR

Enter that directory and compile the code:

  cd $WORKDIR/MKL-ScaLAPACK_Example ; ./compile.sh

After topaz enters production, you will need to edit submit.pbs to place
the allocation charge code for your PBS job after
#PBS -A.

Submit the job:

  qsub submit.pbs

Review the mpiexec_mpt command statement in submit.pbs and the output when
the job is done.
