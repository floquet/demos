To compile MPI codes with Intel IMPI:

There are two compilers, Intel and Gnu.
of MPI - SGI's MPT and Intel's IMPI.

Read Intel_MPI.txt to find which MPI compiler scripts to use to compile
and which modules to use to execute Intel MPI code.

If no specific version number is stated, then the default is assumed,
although you may use any available version.  The default version is
15.0.3.

To see what module mpi/intelmpi/16.0.0 is, for example, enter
"module show compiler/intel/16.0.0".
