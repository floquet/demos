How to use Totalview to Debug a Parallel Code in an Interactive PBS Job


This example demonstrates how to start a TotalView debug session in a PBS job.

Copy the code and compilation script to your $WORKDIR and run there.

To compile:
  The compilation requires the Intel compilers.
  You can either
  -  run "compile" from the command line, or
  -  copy the compile line in "compile" to the command line and
     hit <enter>.

Edit the PBS job script to conform to your project (enter the correct
project code after #PBS -A) and submit the job.
