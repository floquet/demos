Amount of Memory that a Process uses:
=====================================

This is an example of determining the amount of memory being used by a
process.  The code in the files measure_memory.c and measure_memory.h
show two methods of finding the memory usage that will work on many
Linux operating systems.

In the sample applications, each of 72 MPI processes allocates a different
amount of memory, and the amount of memory usage before and after malloc
is printed for a quarter of the processes.

Instructions: Copy this example to a directory you own:
   cp -R $SAMPLES_HOME/Programming/Memory_Usage /path/to/destination/directory

Build the executables by executing the script "compile.sh".
   ./compile.sh

Submitting a job is done with submit.pbs.  Until topaz enters production,
use
   qsub submit.pbs

After topaz enters production, use

   qsub -A your-project-code submit.pbs

Your project code can be found by entering "show_usage" at the command prompt.
