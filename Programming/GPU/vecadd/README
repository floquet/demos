If the GPU capability is not given during compilation,
then the lowest capability will be chosen.  In order
to use all of the capabilities of the NVIDIA GPU,
the capability should be set with the following option:

   -gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35

The usage of the above option is shown in the file compile.sh .

Copy these files to a workspace that you own.

Build the executable using the command
./compile.sh
Run the job using the command
qsub vecadd.pbs
