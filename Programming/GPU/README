ATTENTION: Driver for CUDA 7.5 has not yet been installed.
ATTENTION: Initially, use module cuda/6.5 .

Topaz also has 32 GPU nodes, each populated with two
2.6-GHz Intel Xeon E5-2697v3 Haswell 64-bit 14-core processors
(for a total of 28 cores) and an NVIDIA Tesla K40P GPU.
Each GPU node has 128 GBytes of memory for the CPUs
and 10.8 GBytes of GDDR5 memory on the GPU boards.
(The GPU board, has 12 GB physical memory but only
around 10.8 GB is available for user programs.)

To utilize a node with a GPU, the user needs to add the
PBS option "ngpus=1".  As shown below

#PBS -l select=<number of nodes>:ncpus=28:mpiprocs=<procs per node>:ngpus=1

To compile GPU-capable code, the cuda module must be loaded.

module load cuda

or a specific version such as cuda/6.5, cuda/7.0 or cuda/7.5 .

The compiler nvcc uses the Gnu compiler suite.
A compiler more advanced than /usr/bin/gcc is recommended.
The compiler module be swapped as shown below.

module swap compiler/intel/15.0.3 compiler/gcc/4.8.5

The compilation scripts "compile.sh" load the cuda module
explicitly prior to compiling the binaries.
