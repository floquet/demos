 
At present there are unlimited DDT Tokens available at all Centers.

To start DDT in a batch job on compute nodes, you need to run an interactive
batch job.  So first check to see how many cores are free using "qview".

You should issue the command "ssh -Y topaz.erdc.hpc.mil" to get an SSH
tunnel to Topaz from your (*nix) machine, or if you are using Windows, start a
X-Server such as Xming or Cygwin, and then in PuTTy set the X11 forwarding
in PuTTy's SSH - X11 Category table.

Once on Topaz' login node, test the SSH tunnel with an "xclock".

To get the X DISPLAY sent from your interactive batch job to your desktop,
add the PBS option "-X" to the interactive command, as in the following
interactive batch session with allocated compute nodes:
  > qsub -X -A myproject -l walltime=01:00:00 -q debug -l select=2:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36 -I
Here, the string "myproject" should be the project id string under which you
are performing this work.  It is listed if you execute "show_usage".

Once interactive the batch session starts, do
  > cd /p/work1/---/where_work_is

Alternatively,
  > cd $WORKDIR/.../where_work_is

Then test that your X11 display works from the PBS mom node:
  > xclock

Load your DDT module:
  > module load ddt 

Now you can run ddt on your executable, in this example mpi_test.x:
  > ddt -n 64 ./mpi_test.x

A graphic window should come up, possibly after messages about having to
restart because Allinea's fixed-width font couldn't be found so having to
search for X fonts instead.

The windows should display a pane with various choices for your code.  If
the OpenMP box is checked, uncheck it for this example.  The code is pure MPI.

Select run.  And hit the green arrow.

The code will execute until the exception is encountered, and the line that
generated the error will be displayed.  If you continue, error messages will
be generated.  Here, the flag "-traceback" tells the compiler to issue
instructions to generate a traceback listing in the event an exception is
encountered.  In DDT, that trace will be displayed in one of the panes, and
examination there will inform that the error occurred on line 25.
